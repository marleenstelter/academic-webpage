Hi, my name is Marleen Stelter and I am a social psychologist. My research focusses on how people perceive others and how social perceptions are influenced by social group memberships. I investigate how stereotypes and prejudice affect peoples perceptions and behaviors towards individuals of stigmatized individuals. Furthermore, I investigate how perceived 'race' affects memory for faces. It is a well-known phenomenon that people are better at recognizing people from their own 'racial' group compared to people from other groups. For example, White people are often better at recognizing White faces compared to Black or Asian faces. This effect can have severe consequences, for example in the context of eye-witness identifications. In my research, I am trying to understand *why* this so-called other-'race' effect occurs and *how* it can be overcome.
